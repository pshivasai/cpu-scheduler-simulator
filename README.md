# CPU Scheduling Algorithm Visualizer

A web-based simulator to visualize and compare CPU scheduling algorithms â€” **First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)** and **Shortest Job First (SJF)**.

# Features

- Add custom processes with burst time input
- Visualize CPU execution with Gantt charts
- Compare FCFS and SJF algorithms side-by-side
- Displays Turnaround Time (TAT) and Waiting Time (WT) for each process
- Calculates average TAT and WT
- Intuitive GUI built with HTML & CSS
- Core scheduling logic written in JavaScript

# Algorithms Implemented

-FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve): Non-preemptive scheduling based on process arrival order
-SJF (Shortest Job First): Non-preemptive scheduling based on burst time
